Welcome to Weird Aunt Heather's Adventures in Learning to Code- Python Edition

A bit about me:
I'm a Weird Ole Redhead (actually, it's Auburn)...
Self-Taught-Jane-of-All-Trades, with too many interests for my own good...
I never go anywhere without a towel, and can recite the 'Extestential Blues' by heart (because my singing voice is atrocious)...

After 36 years of 'dabbling' at, and driving my family crazy 'playing around' with my favorite 'hobbies' (reading and experimenting with the workings of computers, all manner of electronics, gadgets and software), I am finally enrolled in a real class, learning how to code.
Thank you LaunchCode, for this opportunity!!! It means a great deal to me =)
